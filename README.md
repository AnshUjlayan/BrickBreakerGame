# Brick Breaker Game

Brick Breaker Game is a Java-based interactive game inspired by the classic brick breaker game. The objective is to break the bricks distributed at the top of the game screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle. The player must prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen using the paddle.

## Features

- Ball and Paddle Interaction: The paddle allows the player to bounce the ball back into play. The ball's trajectory can be influenced based on the position of the paddle at the time of contact.
- Brick Breaking: The bricks are destroyed when the ball collides with them. Each broken brick contributes to the player's score.
- Scoring System: The game includes a scoring mechanism that reflects the player's efficiency in clearing the bricks. Factors such as the total number of paddle hits and the maximum brick hits per trip can affect the score.

## Game Mechanics

- Paddle Movement: The player can control the paddle using user input to move it horizontally along the bottom of the screen.
- Ball Bouncing: When the ball hits the paddle, its direction changes. However, the angle of the bounce is not purely mirrored. The closer the ball hits the left end of the paddle, the more significant the leftward deviation from the expected mirror bounce.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Build and run the project.

## Future Enhancements

- Power-ups: Implement power-ups that can enhance the player's abilities or provide temporary advantages.
- Levels and Difficulty: Introduce different levels with varying brick formations and difficulty levels to keep the game engaging.
- Sound Effects and Visuals: Enhance the gaming experience with appropriate sound effects and appealing visuals.
